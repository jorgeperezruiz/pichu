Simple example using pokeapi.co

The app is only a list with the first 250 pokemons. 
When a name is clicked, a detailed view with some basic pokemon information will be shown. 

There are still some refactoring needed to change the prefix "game" to "pokemon"
This is because initially the idea was to use a Games api instead of the Pokemon api.
